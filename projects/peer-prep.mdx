### Overview  

As part of a software development course, I did a group project to create a microservice-based web application for collaborative code editing. It includes features like user authentication, collaborative code editing and a chat api with ChatGPT. I was responsible for writing the code in the User Service and the Attempts Service.

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Developed with Next.js/React for interactive and responsive UI/UX.
- **Backend**: Built using Express/Node.js, ensuring robust server-side functionality.
- **Databases**: Utilized MongoDB for flexible document storage and PostgreSQL for structured data, optimizing data management across services.

### Microservices 
  
- **User Service**: Manages user accounts, authentication, and profile information
- **Question Service**: Users can create and manage events.  
- **Matching Service**: 
- **Collaboration Service**: Handles collaborative code editing via RabbitMQ
- **AI Service**: Handles chat functionality with ChatGPT
- **Attempts Service (bundled with User Service)**: Handles saving of code during attempts of every user

### Architecture

The backend consists of microservices, each of which is run in a separate docker container. The frontend communicates with these microservices via HTTP requests using an Nginx API Gateway.

For the user service/attempts service, the code can be broadly be thought of to follow a layered architecture consisting of a web layer, service layer, data access layer and the database.

- **Web Layer**: The web layer handles the public APIs for the User Service. It consists of a Node.js Express application that exposes REST endpoints for client and other services to integrate with.
- **Service Layer**: The service layer contains the logic and coordination across components. It handles tasks like authentication and request validation and consists of the middlewares and routes.
- **Data Access Layer**: The data layer abstracts the underlying PostgreSQL database. It consists of the functions to interact with the database in the controller
- **Database**: The database (written in PostgreSQL for the user and attempts service) stores the user information and attempts

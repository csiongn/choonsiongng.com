## Peer Prep
[GitHub repository: https://github.com/CS3219-AY2324S1/ay2324s1-course-assessment-g26](https://github.com/CS3219-AY2324S1/ay2324s1-course-assessment-g26)
  
### Overview  

I created web application for collaborative code editing as a group project for one of my software engineering courses. It includes features like user authentication, event scheduling, and real-time notifications. I was responsible for writing the code in the User Service and the Attempts Service.

### Technology Stack  
  
- Next.JS/React for the frontend  
- Express/NodeJS for the backend  
- MongoDB and PostgreSQL for the databases

### Microservices 
  
- **User Service**: Manages user accounts, authentication, and profile information
- **Question Service**: Users can create and manage events.  
- **Matching Service**: 
- **Collaboration Service**: Handles collaborative code editing via RabbitMQ
- **AI Service**: Handles chat functionality with ChatGPT
- **Attempts Service (bundled with User Service)**: Handles saving of code during attempts

### Architecture

The backend consists of microservices, each of which is run in a separate docker container. The frontend communicates with these microservices via HTTP requests using an Nginx API Gateway.

For the user service/attempts service, the code can be broadly be thought of to follow a layered architecture where there is
